        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is causing massive disruption in the health and wellness
          industry. The smartphone's omnipresence has created a massive market
          for mobile health apps, wearables, and biometric trackers. Healthcare
          digital products are gaining popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A survey by Gallup reveals that
          <strong
            >nearly half (45%) of Americans have at least tried digital health
            products such as fitness trackers or mobile health apps</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Health apps (also known as mHealth apps) are mobile applications that
          offer health-related services on smartphones, tablets, and other
          communication devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are numerous mHealth apps available, each focusing on a
          different aspect of wellness. Among the most popular categories are:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Exercise and fitness apps</li>
          <li>Reminders and habits tracker apps</li>
          <li>Sleep quality apps</li>
          <li>Woman's health apps</li>
          <li>Diet and nutrition apps</li>
          <li>Mental health apps</li>
          <li>Stress reduction apps</li>
          <li>Meditation apps</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Client</strong></p>
        <p>
          To start this new challenge, they gave to us a client with a briefing
          about the product that we will create.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Daily Health Conference is a non-profit organization dedicated to
          promoting health and wellness through impactful public talks,
          participatory workshops, and professional training all over the world.
          The Daily Health Conference began in 1983 in San Francisco as a
          conference where Medicine, Health, and Wellness converged, and it now
          covers nearly all health-related topics — from nutrition to sleep to
          addiction — in over 100 languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Daily Health Conference offers an online membership on their
          website. Even though The Daily Health Conference has numerous years of
          experience in the field, its program has been slow to catch up with
          technology. They have seen a substantial drop in memberships.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
        <p>
          While brainstorming what the new mobile apps should do, the board
          realized that the opportunities for translating the concept of
          wellness into a digital product are virtually infinite. Their members
          could use their apps to keep track of diet plans, fitness programs,
          mental wellness, stress levels, water intake, and so on. The
          possibilities are endless and they are not exactly sure where to
          begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >We will conduct user research to understand people’s relationships
            with mental, physical, and emotional well-being. And then create a
            prototype for a tool that will motivate people to take action.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The National Wellness Institute wants designers to rethink how people
          can adopt and maintain a routine that enhances their well-being. The
          tool can be focused on any category related to personal wellness such
          as (but not limited to): exercise and fitness, food/diet, meditation,
          time management, etc. The UI must reflect a new and updated image.

        <h2>Desktop Research</h2>
        <p>
          With the challenge in our hands, we defined which path to follow
          inside the wellness theme, and the chosen one was
          <strong>habit builder/tracker</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this research, we gathered information on some articles and books
          about building and tracking habits such as what is a habit tracker,
          how to build a healthy habit, how to maintain a good habit, and the
          benefits of having good and healthy habits to follow.
        </p>
        <h4>So, what is a habit tracker?</h4>
        <p>
          A habit tracker is a
          <strong>simple way to measure whether you did a habit</strong>. The
          most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you
          stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday,
          Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X.
        </p>
        <h4>Habit formation</h4>
        <p>
          Why do humans have habits? One likely reason people are creatures of
          habit is that <strong>habits are efficient</strong>: people can
          perform useful behaviors without wasting time and energy deliberating
          about what to do. This tendency toward quick-and-efficient responses
          can backfire, however — when it gets hijacked by the use of addictive
          drugs or the consumption of unhealthy food.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Habits are built through learning and repetition.</strong> A
          person is thought to develop a habit in the course of pursuing goals
          (such as driving to a destination or satisfying an appetite) by
          beginning to associate certain cues with behavioral responses that
          help meet the goal (turning at certain streets, or stopping at a
          drive-thru with a familiar sign). Over time, thoughts of the behavior
          and ultimately the behavior itself are likely to be triggered by these
          cues.
        </p>
        <h4>What is a habit loop?</h4>
        <p>
          A “habit loop” is a way of describing several related elements that
          produce habits. These elements have been called the cue (or trigger),
          the routine (or behavior), and the reward. For example, stress could
          serve as a cue that one responds to by eating, smoking, or drinking,
          which produces the reward (the reduction of stress — at least
          temporarily). The “habit loop” concept was popularized by Charles
          Duhigg in The Power of Habit.
        </p>
        <h4>What's the difference between a habit and a routine?</h4>
        <p>
          While a routine involves repeated behavior, it's not necessarily
          performed in response to an ingrained impulse, like a habit is. You
          might routinely wash the dishes or go to the gym without feeling an
          impulse to do so because you feel you need to do those things.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of a habit tracker are that it reminds the user to act,
          motivates the user, and also gives the satisfaction of a mission
          accomplished.
        </p>
        <h4>But for how long do we need to track our habits?</h4>
        <p>
          With our desktop research, we found a study from Psychology
          researchers from University College London that indicates that on
          average it takes a little more than 2 months before a new behavior
          becomes automatic, <strong>66 days precisely</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having all the information we gathered on the topic, we started
          researching habit applications to start analyzing competitors, which
          features they have, and how they work.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          We analyzed 4 apps and put our analysis in the feature and brand
          comparison charts, and in a market positioning map.

          To complete our research, we did some interviews and also a survey to
          know more from people about what they know about habit
          trackers/builders and what they think about habits.
        </p>

    <div class="work-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Survey and Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          We did a survey with a total of 19 people to know the people's habits,
          what they do to keep a routine of good habits if they want to quit bad
          habits, if they have something to help build good habits and quit bad
          habits and if it is important to have some guidance in order to keep
          this kind of routine.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="images/survey.png" width="100%" alt="Survey" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The majority of people have an interest in new habits, but they have 3
          main problems: <strong>concentrating</strong>,
          <strong>following a routine</strong>, and
          <strong>lack of guidance</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>Interviews</h4>
        <p>
          We conducted an interview with 5 people to continue our research on
          the topic and we collected good answers to our questions. We asked the
          interviewees about their lives, how they define their routine (if they
          have one), what habits they consider good and bad, what helped them
          when they were trying to build good habits, what keeps them motivated,
          and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the following chart is the most common answers that the
          interviewees gave to us:

          After the research, survey and interviews, we came to this next step
          to discover the pain points and needs of the users and turn them into
          design opportunities. We divided the information into 3 supergroups:
          <strong>user profile</strong>, <strong>methodology</strong>, and
          <strong>blockers</strong>.

          We also did an <strong>Empathy Map</strong> where we can capture what
          the user feels and how the user behaves, what the user thinks, does,
          sees, says, and hears. It is an important tool to realize what are the
          pain points and expectations that the user has.

          Marina is a 35 years old woman from Rotterdam. She works as a nurse at
          the Erasmus Medical Center since 3 years ago. She is a super positive
          and happy woman and she loves her job but it keeps her very busy and
          makes her feel tired. Because she is a nurse, she sees on a daily
          basis the consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle. <br />
          So now, Marina is in a time of her life that
          <strong>she wants to have a healthier life</strong> and
          <strong>get rid of bad habits</strong> that she has been building up
          in her life, but she doesn't know how or where to start.

            >This makes her feel unmotivated and quit quickly after
            starting</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give Marina what she needs, we defined the
          <strong>problem statement</strong>: people that don't know how to
          build a habit, need to find a way to
          <strong>have guidance</strong> because
          <strong>they don't know where to start</strong>.

          We created the first user flow and then we did a concept testing with

          goal of our user flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          After we received feedback based on the concept testing, we found out
          that they liked the Everest metaphor and the idea of a 66 days
          challenge, they also liked the idea to complete regular check-ins and
          the rewarding idea but were skeptical about how valuable the rewards
          would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we changed a few things in our user flow for the user to have a

        <h2>Low-Fi, Mid-Fi & Usability Test</h2>

        <p>
          We did some Crazy 8 sketches for the low-fi and after that, we shaped
          more the features to start the mid-fi.

        <p>
          When our mid-fi was ready, we used it for a
          <strong>Usability Test</strong> with 6 people focused on
          <strong>3 missions</strong>: Set a new goal, Perform your "Daily Task"
          and Check your progress. The charts below show the results:

            And after we did the Usability Test, we changed a few things in our
            prototype to continue the project.

        <h2>Brand Attributes & Moodboard</h2>
        <p>
          This is when our brands start to get in shape. For the
          <strong>brand attributes</strong>, we thought about
          <strong>Marina</strong>, on how she will climb her own Everest, and
          for that our app needed to be <strong>DYNAMIC</strong>,
          <strong>CONSISTENT</strong>, <strong>AMBITIOUS</strong>,
          <strong>SUPPORTIVE</strong>, <strong>BOLD</strong>, and of course,
          <strong>FRIENDLY</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all that in mind, we created a moodboard, with the colors and
          images that bring all those feelings for our user.

        </div>
        <h4>Style Tile</h4>
        <p>
          For the app to be more concise and follow a pattern, we created this
          Style Tile that becomes our guide, our base for the next step of this
          project, which is the creation of the app's Hi-Fi prototype.
