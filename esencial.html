        <h2>Esencial</h2>
        <p>
          We did a thorough design process, focusing on gathering information
          about the stakeholder and customers to deliver a good and functional
          website, and in this case study, I'll explain what we did step by
          step.
        </p>
        <h4>The interview</h4>
        <p>
          The first thing we did was an interview with Angel to understand
          better his business and to offer him one possible digital solution for
          his service. Those are the highlights of what he said to us:
        </p>
        <h4>For whom is your consulting service is directed?</h4>
        <p>
          Medium, small companies, with the whole team, teaching culture. In the
          big companies with the team leaders, directors, and managers.
        </p>
        <h4>What are the values of your company?</h4>
        <p>
          Coherence between what you say and what you do. Honesty and integrity,
          development, continuous learning, responsibility.
        </p>
        <h4>
          In the market today, do you see any competition for what you are
          offering?
        </h4>
        <p>
          There are a lot of companies of consulting and coaching. But I believe
          everyone has some unique value proposition, I don't want to compete, I
          would like to offer something different to my target.
        </p>
        <h4>How do you organize your workflow?</h4>
        <p>
          I offer methodologies purpose on how to operate in the market and how
          to organize tasks through agile methodology, lean start-up, there are
          a lot of useful techniques.
        </p>
        <h4>Which is your sales strategy? Does it have any cost?</h4>
        <p>
          Right now I'm making posts on Linkedin, connecting with people through
          it, and offering my services. I don't have any sales strategy yet.
        </p>

          At Esencial they do strategic-cultural transformation with teams, from
          within. They help companies to generate more value for their customers
          by bringing businesses closer to people and building a human and
          effective culture.

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          After we did the interview with Angel, we made a research about his
          competitors. We put our research in the feature and brand comparison
          charts, and in a market positioning map.

          We learned that having a professional website for consultant
          freelancers is a
          <strong>must-have for showcasing their services</strong>. It allows a
          new audience to find them on the internet, the consultant can share
          their previous clients' testimonials and with that, get qualified
          leads. We have also learned that most of the time people hire
          freelancer consultants via LinkedIn, freelance specialized websites,
          or mouth-to-mouth.

        <h2>User Persona</h2>
        <p>
          Alexandra Garcia is the user that we created to be Angel's future
          client based on the affinity diagram that we did. We will use her as
          our guide through our process of developing the website.
        </p>

        <p>
          She is the CEO of a medium size company specialized in handmade
          jewelry.
          <strong>She wants her sales to grow and in the future</strong>,
          <strong>expand her business to a second store</strong>, but Alexandra
          <strong>doesn't know</strong> how to find a
          <strong>good and trustworthy consultant online</strong>, because there
          are a lot of consultants and not so many with the right information
          that she seeks to have the trust she needs for her business.
        </p>
        <p>
          With both the persona and the stakeholder in mind, we started to find
          our problem statement for the two of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The problem statement for the stakeholder:</strong> Angel's
          website was designed to achieve selling consulting services to small
          and medium companies. We have observed that the lack of information
          provided about the service is not meeting the user's expectation for a
          trustworthy experience which is causing a negative impact on the
          sales/booking to his business.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The problem statement for the users:</strong> Small (&lt;15)
          and medium (&lt;50) business owner need to find a way to book trustful
          transparent business from companies that provides an overview of their
          service because they need to see what they pay for and they need to
          rely on the person to make their company grow.

        <h2>How Might We?</h2>
        <p>
          After we established the problem statements we reached the phase of
          the HMW and the brainstorming of the HMW’s that we gathered. We did a
          voting process to decide what were the most important features that
          the website needed to have to achieve both Angel’s and the user’s
          goals.

        <p>
          We created the sitemap showing the relationship between the pages we
          thought was necessary according to the features we found in our How
          Might We process.

        </div>
        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>
          We made a first user flow based on the sitemap we created. After that,
          we did concept testing with 5 people to test the path the user would
          have to take to reach the goal of our user flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          After we received feedback based on the concept testing, we found out
          that this kind of service should be done in a very personalized way,
          for this reason, we deleted the “packages section” and left just the
          contact section to be contacted by the consultant to create a personal
          individualized business plan.

        <p>
          With all the information organized and cleared, we started to build
          our mid-fi wireframe for Angel's website and after we finished this
          part, the interactive prototype was made.

        <h2>Brand Attributes and Moodboard</h2>
        <p>
          In this phase, was the time to create the attributes for the brand, in
          our case, Esencial and also a moodboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the <strong>brand attributes</strong> that we found about
          Esencial:
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3>The design team:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Reliability</li>
            <li>Transparency</li>
            <li>Commitment</li>
            <li>Innovation</li>
            <li>Human</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          As a consultancy, <strong>trust</strong> is a key factor in Esencial —
          which is built by the aforementioned attributes — it's what really
          converts a qualified lead into a client.

        <h4>Colors</h4>

        <p>
          After a voting process, we came to a conclusion about the colors used
          on the hi-fi wireframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colors were chosen to convey confidence, transparency, innovation,
          dynamism, and sobriety. The main color is a variety of turquoise,
          which gives the structure of the website and coherence to the user
          flow. The secondary color is a kind of orange which complements the
          turquoise. The accent colors were used to highlight some spots on the
          website.

        <h4>Typography</h4>
        <p>
          We also did a voting process for the typography and in the end, the
          chosen one was Roboto typeface.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose Roboto to give a clear and clean aspect to the text on the
          website. But also because this typeface gives a sober facet and
          expresses what Esencial is.
