              <h3>Overview:</h3>
              <p>
                This is the 3rd project that I did for Ironhack UX/UI bootcamp
                and the challenge was to redesign an app. I chose the food
                delivery app Thuisbezorgd.nl.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>The Process:</h3>
              <p>
                This was a redesign challenge, so I used Heuristics Analysis and
                the Design Thinking process to get to the final solution.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h3>About the App:</h3>
            <p>
              Thuisbezorgd.nl is a Dutch multinational online food ordering and
              delivery company founded in 2000, it is part of Takeaway.com, one
              of the world's largest food ordering sites.

        <h2>Heuristics Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          I started the project by doing the Heuristics Analysis, reviewing the
          app interface, and doing some comments about what I was seeing. The
          analysis results in a list of potential usability issues with scores
          from high to low.
        </p>
        <p>
          This usability review showed a poor score on some of the app's screens
          like search screen, restaurant page and also some issues with the
          ordering path that the user needs to follow for ordering food.

        <h2>Desktop Research and Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          To continue my project, I looked into the App Store and Google Play to
          search for what the user is saying about the app Thuisbezorgd.nl and I
          found some very interesting comments that served to complement my
          research along with the interviews I did. Below you can see some of
          the comments that I use in my research.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            src="images/coments.png"
            width="750"
            alt="Some reviews about the app"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          For the interviews, what I captured was that
          <strong>the user is bothered</strong> by the fact that some of the
          <strong
            >restaurants don't show pictures of the dishes, and the information
            about the food is not well structured</strong
          >. This is something that is not very well concise inside the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also in the interviews, the users said that
          <i
            >“the process of ordering could be easier, the pictures could be
            bigger or at least clickable to see in a bigger size.”</i
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I gathered all the information I could and with that, Diana Alves
          came to life as my User Persona.
        </p>

        <h2>User Persona</h2>
        <img src="images/user-persona.png" width="100%" alt="User Persona" />
        <p>
          She is a Brazilian expat living in the Netherlands. Diana likes to try
          food from everywhere through delivery, but dishes are in Dutch, and
          she can't understand much; <strong>she is a visual person</strong>,
          she needs to see pictures of the dishes and she thinks the order flow
          is confusing.
        </p>

        <p>
          And to help Diana, I created my <strong>Value Proposition</strong>: A
          concise structure to the restaurant's page, with a standard hierarchy
          of information and photos so that the user better understands what
          they are choosing to eat and also gives the user a good quality of
          path inside the app.

        <h2>UI Solution</h2>
        <p>
          To start the UI part of this project, I gave some attributes to the
          brand in order to make the moodboard.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Friendly</strong>, <strong>Care</strong> and
          <strong>Deliver</strong> are the brand attributes. I used these words
          to express what the brand wants to convey to users, and how they want
          to approach the user, using this also to create the moodboard.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img src="images/moodboard.png" width="550" alt="Moodboard" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Since my main objective was not to give the app a major change, I kept
          the Thuisbezorgd app's original colors and some of its typography.

          structured, I created this Style Tile that becomes my guide for the
          next step of this project, which is the creation of the app's Hi-Fi
          prototype.
